#what about pulling out just X and Y chromosomes from multiple species (cow, horse, sheep, pig) and creating a fasta of those sequences, then creating an index of those, then align MYLU to that?


IDEA:
once you get the genomes from your bats back... can you look at core/unique gene regions like in Roary with bacteria?
