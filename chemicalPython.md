# on the soapbox
We have a few goals with this notebook:  
1) **Work smarter, not harder**. Why spend most of your time in class performing calculations when computers can do them for you? Let's use computers what they're made to do: compute!
2) **Learn something useful**. It's natural to ask the question *why do I need to learn this material*. It's also pretty natural to hear some convoluted response about how if you want to be an X or Y in life, you're going to need to know A, B, and C. Sure... Yes, you're going to learn chemistry. But realize that this project will simultaneously provide you with a small set of computational tools that you can apply in the short term and long term, whether you're interested in engineering, economics, or fantasy football (okay, [or sabermetrics broadly](https://shenjeffreydatascience.tumblr.com/post/101741302014/data-science-sabermetrics)). In other words - this computer stuff? It applies to everything that has anything to do with using data. And just about any career you think about can use some sort of data analytic tools you'll start to use here.  
3) **Learn by doing**. Plain and simple - let's actually do the stuff you're learning about. Code. Break code. Recode. Learn.

# almost ready to start
First things first - how are we going to do any of this? I wanted to take a second to explain how we're going to communicate all of this. Generally the way we're going to explain something for you to do is by separating the text you see here with a `block of instructional code` which is unique from this information. Below are two examples that show one of two situations you will often come across: doing some sort of calculation (example 1) or downloading some sort of software (example 2).  

**Example 1 - example code to perform some calculation**
```
## example 1: some sort of calculator
x = 12
y = 4
print (x+y)
```
**Example 2 - example code to download some software**
```
## example 2: some sort of software
cd $HOME
conda install -c http://conda.binstar.org/gabrielelanaro chemlab
## see documentation here: http://chemlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html
```
What's nice about the code blocks above is that you'll often just copy and paste from this screen and on to another screen. Nice - you don't even have to type much in this project! Another thing worth mentioning - see those `##` characters above? - they're used in code blocks as *comments*; that is, they don't actually get interpreted by the computer to execute anything - they're just used by the programmer (me/you) to communicate with the user (you/me) about what is going on within the code. Pay attention for them as they often provide useful insights into what's going on with the code.  

Once software is downloaded (that's next!), you'll follow along with the instructions on other webpages to complete individual lessons. Fortunately though, the format is the same: some explanatory text and some code blocks. Think of this page as the introductory guide to getting you going with the installation work. Other webpages are dedicated to the individual lessons. Let's get started!  

# The downloads
## Part 1 - Big install: Anaconda
One side note to star things off:  
> this program is big, so ensure you have enough hard drive space before install. Ask if you aren't sure. I probably should have written this course for an Amazon Cloud instance and you can remind me of my mistake in class when a dozen students have 2008 Dell machines running Windows Vista.*  

**Step 1**: Download Anaconda
- Go [to this site](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) and download the software appropriate for your OS (Operating System).

## Part 2 - Tiny install: 
What to do: easy - just
