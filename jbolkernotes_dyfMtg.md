# Broad question
What to focus on in making the argument that I'm a worthy candidate. 
- Do I emphasize the dozen projects I'm working on, or does that give the impression that I'm not ready to finish?  
- Do I keep things simple on whatever projects are addressed, or go into detail? I think the emphasis has to be about the novelty of the project, as well as the importance to the community. What about incorporating the incorporation of a new technology to UNH labs, not just my own project?
- How do I address the fact that I have only published one paper in 4 years at UNH?
- Do I mention that I'm on my 3rd advisor in 4 years? The reality is that the collection of projects I have going are a result of my goal to gain as broad a skill set as possible - is that worth nothing? How to point out the obvious that I don't have one project but many...?? There are 4 double-spaced pages to use - how do I best organize this to keep attention with limited space?
- It seems like the more things that are piled on, the more the group will think that these issues can't be completed in a year. How do I emphasize that the bulk of the molecular work is complete, and that the remaining time is spent on data analysis and writing?
- Is there a way to oragnize the schedule to be unique? Does everyone basically get 2 points automatically for having an organized approach? the scoring guide doesn't really demonstrate what separates a good from bad schedule...

# Impressions from dyf presentation
- highlight 3-minute thesis; what about focusing on web page?
- every faculty member reads this - how to appeal to braod audience with work?
- how to structure Scholarly Achievement sub section with regards to publications vs. presentations... how to highlight press? 
  - related... do I talk about the variety of ongoing projects?
  
  
# Sample DYFs observations for Proposal section
## Math
- Introduction took up 2 of 4 pages to get to their own project... Seems like too much background. Nothing in scoring guidelines suggests the need for background - they specify you need to articulate the _purpose and methods_ used in your own work... so why waste that space on others work? How much background makes for a useful argument, when nothing in the guidelines suggest background info is needed?

My proposal
I'm a very visual person, and I think I can compress a lot of the complicated context that serves as the purpose for my work into a few diagrams. Do you think it would be helpful to include these in lieu of extensive writing? I can shrink images, but can't ever shrink text. Might be a good solution... but what kinds of illustrations?
