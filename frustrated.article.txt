Little things are frustrating.

I wanted to run a program. Most programs depend on other programs. These are called dependencies. I've been using a program for two years now and things have been updated from that end, and the dependencies have been updated on their end. This can cause problems. So I went along with manual installation of each program, checking each version but faced roadblocks on each level.

First with a remote server: I can't control all updates to get all versions in sync. Admin problems.
Second with an Amazon instance: I can't control how much memory and storage to get for free. Poor student problems.
Third with my own machine. I can sudo everything if need be. But then I ran into the fact that there are multiple Python versions. Python problems.

Fortunately I was able to update where Python will look for all of these installed updated dependencies. Thank you random site: http://ask.xmodulo.com/change-syspath-pythonpath-python.html.
