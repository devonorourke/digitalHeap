# a bunch of things to do...
1. list of needed programs for Premise for Toni
2. review Premise PPT and website from Toni’s email
3. review Anaconda virtual environment code; setup Python notebook with notes
4. develop list of questions for Toni
	- how do I get colors set up correct for bash shell?
	- how do I properly edit/add to PATH? just in .bashrc?
	- what are the differences between .bashrc, .profile, and .bash_profile?
	- what are the guides behind using directories like: /local /usr/local /lib /opt, etc.?
	- how do we migrate the /leo directory to Premise? how do do this with Matt M.?
5. get Toni to get amptk running with Slurm… how do I blend together the entire amptk workflow?

# and then...
- demultiplex IM4 from lib05 to determine any potential contaminants  
- if lucky, look at Lib07 (if Steve gets it done) to determine how to proceed with mock communities, water, primers, for Lib08… IF NOT… then just make another batch of mock IM4… add to 2 sheets and use R script to generate list of sampleIDs/barcodeIDs for Steve and submit.  

- continue with guide for lib prep and target capture in Github
