# Jupyter Notebook
So recall that in the [introductory lesson](https://github.com/devonorourke/digitalHeap/blob/master/hssci/lesson0.md) we downloaded [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/what-is-anaconda/), which contained [Python](https://www.python.org/about/gettingstarted/) as well as many other unnamed software packages. Basically, we downloaded some soft of Russian nested dolls of software. As mentioned earlier, one other advantage of doing this big installation was that we could quickly manage future downloads of additional software we might want/need. So to get our first lesson rolling we have to do just that - we need to download a program called [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)!  

You might be considering asking the following questions:  
> 1) How many times are we going to be downloading software? Is that all this course is about?
Answer: You will download software routinely. This is not what the course is about.  
> 2) Why am I downloading *this particular software*?
Answer: Better question! We're using this software because it's a digital notebook which lets you simultaneously write the code you want to perform a function, execute that code within the program, see the output of that code, **AND** let's you separate out all your code, output, and basic note taking into convenient blocks. It does a lot of useful stuff, okay?   
> 3) I don't have any other questions... how do I do this so I can get to lunch?
Answer: See below. And you can eat in lab for all I care.  

# Welcome to your console
Here's the thing - you're going to have to get at least a little bit familiar with a terminal emulator - a.k.a. console. This is the piece of software that will make your parents nod whimsically (or run fearfully). It's the super low-tech-looking (but not actually low tech!) piece of software on every computer that acts as the platform with which you can talk to your computer without clicking anything - just by typing. If you've never used it, it seems really strange. If you have used it before, it seems strangely amazing. However, depending on your OS (Operating System) of choice, you communicate with your console using different languages - in other words, 'speaking' with a Windows machine is executed differently than with a Mac. Here's the basics to consider:  

- Do you have a **Windows machine**? Things are going to be more difficult. In brief: we're going to need to work on this separately before you can move on. I'm going to write all conventions for a Unix OS platform, so it would be best to either [install a Linux distribution directly](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl/install_guide) if you have Windows 10, or perhaps just install a terminal emulator ([one example here](http://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/)) that contains some Unix-like commands needed to do what we're going to do.  
- Do you have a **Linux machine**? Congrats, you're the weird kid. See instructions for Mac below. But you already knew that.  
- Do you have a Mac machine? Sweet. Do two things:  
  - Click on that *Spotlight* search icon in the top right of your computer and look for a program called `Terminal`. Open that up. Now we can talk to the computer!
