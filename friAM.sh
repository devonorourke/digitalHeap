landscape factors:
topographic roughness
annual precipitation
min etemp coldes month
roads and highways
streams and rivers
enhanced vegetation index
percent tree canopy
landcover (forest, open, developed)
null = isolation by distance

use circuitscape to treat landscape as resistor and gene flow as electrial current through resistor
see McRae 2006

multiple regression on distance matrices
- takes into account that data isn't independent...
genetic distances are dependent; landscape resistances are independent
look for correlation


PCAdapt for popgen and pca

important paper to Check out: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26578090... 
take home message? you need strong selection.


calculate per-site heterozygosity for combined RES and SUS populations
calculate per-site Fst for both populations
make scatterplot; look for outlier loci 



DO BOTTLENECK TESTS!!!!!!!
